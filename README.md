### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luc (he/his) and I'm a front-end designer based in Switzerland.

Since more than 16 years, I design and translate into HTML and CSS â€“ with a bit of JavaScript if needed â€“ user interfaces of web sites and applications, taking care of accessibility and [quality (in French)](https://directory.opquast.com/fr/certificat/ASL7K0/).

I'm a passionate jack-of-all-trades, curious and concerned about doing well. I also like learning and sharing. As such I'm glad to participate to meetups or conferences, as attendee, speaker or organizer.
I'm notably a member of the [Paris Web](https://www.paris-web.fr/) association since 2018 and have been its president since May 2020.
